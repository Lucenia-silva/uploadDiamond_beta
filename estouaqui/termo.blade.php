                    Diamond Review Africa , provides its Services to you subject to the Terms of Service outlined in this document,
                     which may be updated by Diamond Review from time to time without notice to you. By accessing the Services,
                      you acknowledge that you have read and understood these Terms of Service, and agree to abide by them.
                    The Terms of Service is the entire agreement regarding your usage of the Services, and supersedes any
                    oral or written communication between you and any employee, officer, or affiliate of Diamond Review Africa.
                    <br>
                     Any waiver of any provision of the Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing and signed by Diamond Review Africa.
                    The Terms of Service and the relationship between you and Diamond Review Africa, shall be governed
                    by the laws of the State of Washington without regard to its conflict of law provisions. You and Diamond Review Africa
                     agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within King County, Washington.
                     You and Diamond Review Africa agree to conduct all legal proceedings exclusively in the English language.
                      The failure of Diamond Review Africa to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service shall
                       not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. <br>If any provision of the Terms of Service is found by a court
                       of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavor to give effect
                        to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the Terms of Service remain in full
                        force and effect. Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, you agree to send written notice to Diamond Review Africa
                        as set forth in Section 9, detailing any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to your use of the Services or the
                        Terms of Service within one (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose, or be forever barred from pursuing such claim
                        or cause of action.
